## Research interests:
Topological phases have materialized as one of the most exciting areas of research in modern condensed matter physics. The topological character of a given phase may present itself in many ways, such as quantized edge currents, patterns of fractionalization, and topology-dependent ground-state degeneracy. Topological phases can host exotic anyonic excitations whose statistics is neither bosonic nor fermionic. Even more strikingly, the anyonic statistics may be history dependent (i.e., depend on their shared topological charge). Such anyons are called "non-Abelian" and have applications in topological quantum computing. Their applications are a major driving force of research on topological phases today, much of which is devoted to answering two questions: First, how can we realize and ultimately manipulate topological phases to our advantage? Second, how do we characterize and classify topological phases of matter? Classifcations are often abstract yet have profound physical consequences. In particular, they determine what nature allows as a matter of principle, in turn prompting us to search for realizations.
